    <h1>Rainbows</h1>
<p>I love rainbows. They are beautiful and make me smile. Rainbow, although several colors is my favorite color.
   When I see a rainbow it reminds of God's promises to me. Standard rainbows consist of red, orange, yellow,
   green, blue, and violet. I like to add hot pink and turquoise(or aqua) to my rainbows. In all, rainbows
are the bomb!</p>
